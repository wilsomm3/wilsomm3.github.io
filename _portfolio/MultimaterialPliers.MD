# Purpose

The aim of this project is to design and develop a microfluidic device, using resin 3D printing technology, that can separate particles based on their size. The method used for separation is pinch flow fractionation (PFF).

# Iterations

## Iteration 1

Infill testing: I printed the TPU joint component in three models with infill percentages of 6%, 8%, and 10%.

Dovetail fit testing: I could not determine the best infill percentage from this iteration because the handle pieces fit too loosely with the joint. The dovetail angles were 70 degrees, the lower dimension was 1.5mm, the upper was 4mm, and the offset clearance between the joint and the PLA pieces was 0.2 mm. This led to more square-like dovetail joints that did not retain the pieces to the joint during pinching.

# Application of PFF
Pinch flow fractionation is an effective technique for separating particles by size. A few hypothetical applications are given below:
- DNA mutation diagnoses when DNA segments have been cleaved and are smaller than others
- Testing blood by separating it into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets
- Identifying environmental pollutants in water

In all of these applications, the greatest benefit of using microfluidic devices compared to other testing devices is the reduced sample volume needed. For example, instead of taking pints of blood, a patient can give a sample as small as 5 mL, and the device would function. This significantly reduces cost as well.
