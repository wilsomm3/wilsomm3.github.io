I am looking for a job in the medical device industry where I can combine prototyping and communication skills to deliver an effective product for improving patient outcomes.

## Education

I am pursuing a degree in biomedical engineering where she will have gained skills in management, manufacturing, and programming due to intentional additions to my course curriculum.

* Vanderbilt University
  * BE Biomedical Engineering (May 2025)
  * Minors:
    * Digital Fabrication
    * Computer Science
    * Engineering Management

## Work Experience

After getting my start in the medical device industry with an internship in Medtronic's spine division, I discovered a passion for the orthopedic field and the mechanical design of surgical instruments and implants. I then pursued an opportunity to learn the product managing side of a company at Medacta, USA while still developing my engineering design skills in CAD and rapid prototyping. I love to understand a design well enough to communicate its rationales and constraints to surgeons, allowing for a more seamless design process.

* Summer 2022: Medtronic Spine Wise Intern (Memphis, TN)
* Summer 2023: Medacta Product Management/Product Development Intern (Franklin, TN)
* Fall 2023: Medacta Extended Part-time Intern
* Summer 2024-Present: Medacta Product Management/Product Development Intern (Franklin, TN)

## Technical Skills

I can design to interface software and hardware components. I have turned my CAD models into 3D printed parts as well as my computer programs into functioning electrical components. My prototyping skills are listed below:

* CAD Design (CSWA Certified)
* Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)
* Java and C++ Programming
* Soldering and Electrical Safety
* Digital Fabrication Tools:
  * Laser Cutting (coming soon)

## Recent Update

Delaney Clawson, VU '24, and I wrapped up our Summer 2024 Product Development internships with Medacta, USA on August 16.
